Zipf's Law Analysis
==================
- Number of unique words analyzed: 116
- Slope (should be close to -1 for perfect Zipf's law): -0.5403
- Intercept: 2.3744
- R² (goodness of fit, 1.0 is perfect): 0.8983

Interpretation:
- A slope close to -1 suggests the distribution follows Zipf's law.
- The higher the R² value (closer to 1.0), the better the fit to a power law.
