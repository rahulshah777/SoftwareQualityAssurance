Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia created and edited by volunteers around the world.
It contains millions of articles covering science, technology, history, and popular culture.
The project was launched in 2001 and has grown to become one of the largest knowledge bases.
Editors collaborate by adding citations, improving accuracy, and expanding content.
Open collaboration models allow anyone to contribute to articles on nearly any topic.
